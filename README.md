<br>

##### Handling Missing Values in "Amount" Column:

1) In this data set we have identified missing values in the "Amount" column and decided to remove the rows containing these missing values rather than imputing them with a specific value.
   
##### Removing Unnamed Columns ("unnamed1") and "Status" Column:
In this data set we have removed the columns named "unnamed1" and "Status" since they were not useful for the analysis and contained no data (all values were null).

By removing the null values in the "Amount" column and eliminating irrelevant columns, the dataset was likely streamlined and prepared for further analysis.
