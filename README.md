<br>

##### Handling Missing Values in "Amount" Column:

1) In this data set we have identified missing values in the "Amount" column and decided to remove the rows containing these missing values rather than imputing them with a specific value.
   
##### Removing Unnamed Columns ("unnamed1") and "Status" Column:
In this data set we have removed the columns named "unnamed1" and "Status" since they were not useful for the analysis and contained no data (all values were null).

By removing the null values in the "Amount" column and eliminating irrelevant columns, the dataset was likely streamlined and prepared for further analysis.


# <h4 id="link4"> Exploratory Data Analysis</h4>
<br>
Based on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted on the Diwali sales data, several valuable insights have been uncovered regarding customer behavior and preferences during the Diwali sales period. The analysis revealed that a specific customer segment stands out as more likely to purchase products from certain categories. The conclusion drawn from the analysis is as follows:


1) Target Customer Segment: Married women aged between 26 to 35 years from the states of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Maharashtra, and Karnataka are more inclined to make purchases during the Diwali sales.

2) Occupation: The analyzed data suggests that these customers are predominantly working in the Information Technology (IT), Healthcare, and Aviation industries.

3) Product Categories: This particular customer segment showed a higher tendency to buy products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

4) Marketing Strategy: Considering the strong preference of this customer segment for specific product categories, the company can tailor targeted marketing campaigns to attract and engage these potential buyers. Offering attractive discounts, promotional deals, or loyalty rewards during the Diwali sales might further encourage their purchase behavior.

5) Geographic Focus: Given the significant presence of this customer segment in UP, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, allocating marketing resources and promotions in these regions could yield higher returns during the Diwali sales period.

6) Customer Experience Enhancement: Understanding the preferences and needs of this customer segment will enable the company to enhance the overall customer experience. Personalized product recommendations and customer support catering to their specific interests could further improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
